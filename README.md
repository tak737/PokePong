PokePong

-----Introduction-----

Welcome to PokePong! PokePong is a multiplayer game based on Pong that breathes new life into a 
classic game. In PokePong, four players compete to protect their three Pokemon from the moving 
Pokeball by controlling their paddle. The Pokeball interacts with obstacles as it tries to remove each 
player's Pokemon from the playing field. Once all of a player's Pokemon are 'caught' by the Pokeball, 
that player's paddle stops moving; the last player standing is the winner!

I am currently working on making the gameplay cleaner and implementing more features, including a 
load-in screen where players can select the number of players (2 to 4). I also plan on making this game 
playable online.

Thank you for reading, and I hope that you enjoy!

Sincerely,

-----Running the Program-----

When running the program, compiling requires these two lines:

javac-introcs Game.java
javac-introcs Scoring.java

To play the game, run Game.java:

java-introcs Game

Each player controls two keys on a QWERTY keyboard:
Player 1:  Z and C
Player 2:  M and .
Player 3:  ; and -
Player 4:  2 and A
